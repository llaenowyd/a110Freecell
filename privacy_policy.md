### Privacy Policy - Applies to "com.a110.freecell" [the App] published in the Google Play Store

* What data is collected
  * Aggregated or anonymized statistics about app performance, crashes and user installs/de-installs
    (i.e. adoption or cancellation) are provided by Google via the Google Play Console [Play Store
    dashboard], and this app is opted-into such data collection.
  * The app itself collects no user data. Its source code is published openly at
    https://www.github.com/llaenowyd/a110Freecell, and none of this code is related to the collection
    of user data.

* Disclaimer
  * The app depends on some open source libraries, which in turn also may depend on other open source
    libraries. The directly-declared dependencies are mainstream, highly visible libraries and
    tools, such as mobx-flutter, Metro, gradle, etc. The entirety of the code run by the app is
    not known to me now and is subject to change. However this stack (i.e. entirety of libraries
    on which the app depends) is well regarded by the open-source community, and no dependency has
    been selected or configured in any way to perform any kind of user data collection, beyond
    that provided by the Play Store dashboard by Google, described above.
