+## Material Freecell
+
+### Privacy Policy - Applies to "com.a110.materialfreecell" [the App] published in the Google Play Store
+
+* What data is collected
+  * Aggregated or anonymized statistics about app performance, crashes and user installs/de-installs
+    (i.e. adoption or cancellation) are provided by Google via the Google Play Console [Play Store
+    dashboard], and this app is opted-into such data collection.
+  * The app itself collects no user data. Its source code is published openly at
+    https://www.github.com/llaenowyd/a110Freecell, and none of this code is related to the collection
+    of user data.
+
+* Disclaimer
+  * The app depends on some open source libraries, which in turn also may depend on other open source
+    libraries. The directly-declared dependencies are mainstream, highly visible libraries and
+    tools, such as mobx-flutter, Metro, gradle, etc. The entirety of the code run by the app is
+    not known to me now and is subject to change. However this stack (i.e. entirety of libraries
+    on which the app depends) is well regarded by the open-source community, and no dependency has
+    been selected or configured in any way to perform any kind of user data collection, beyond
+    that provided by the Play Store dashboard by Google, described above.
